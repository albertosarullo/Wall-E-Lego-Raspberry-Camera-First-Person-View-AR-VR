# Wall-E Lego Raspberry 

Give a soul to the Lego Wall-E model using Raspberrypi and some servos.

Compared to the beautifull original model, i have rebuilt:
- the tracks module, beacuse the original track is too small to include hi-torque servo motor
- the neck, beacause i need a complex joint, capable of smooth 3D movement (pitch, roll, yaw)
- the head, beacuse i add a servo for yaw movement

I buy lego spare parts on Ebay, servos adapter on Mindsensors, electronic parts on chinese shop online.
