# Wall-E Lego Raspberry 

I try to give a soul to the beautifull Lego Wall-E model using RaspberryPi and some servos.

Compared to the original model, i have rebuilt:
- the tracks module, beacuse the original track is too small to include hi-torque servo motor
- the neck, beacause i need a complex joint, capable of smooth 3D movement (pitch, roll, yaw)
- the head, beacuse i add a servo for yaw movement

I buy spare bricks on Ebay, servos adapter on Mindsensors, servos and electronic parts on chinese deal websites 

### Todo
- ~~build tracks module~~ (8/11/2015 after 5 revision)
- ~~build neck~~ (29/11/2015 after 4 revision)
- test and tune neck servos with arduino (folder /test)
- rewrite servo code on raspberry
- server on raspberry
- ui for direct control the movement
- add sensors
